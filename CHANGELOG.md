[`oled_async`](https://crates.io/crates/oled_async) is a Rust driver for the SH11xx/SSD1xxx OLED displaya. It
supports [embedded-graphics](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics) or raw pixel drawing modes
and works with the [embedded-hal](crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) traits for maximum portability.
